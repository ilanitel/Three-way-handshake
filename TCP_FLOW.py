PART 1

Three way handshake
Create a Scapy function that receives an IP address, port number, and a text message as arguments. It then
creates a full three-way TCP handshake.
The function must fulfill the following requirements:
a. The function returns 2 variables, one Boolean and one String.
b. If the function successfully connects to the port the Boolean variable returned will be True.
c. The function sends the text message variable to the target after a successful connection and saves
the reply to a string variable â€“ returning it at the end of the program as the String variable
d. If the connection fails, the function returns the Boolean variable as False the string will return as
None
